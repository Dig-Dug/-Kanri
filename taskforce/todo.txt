Step 2 — Backend + Database (with Docker Compose)

Decide on backend framework (Node/Express? Laravel? since you’ve touched it before).

Pick a database (Postgres is clean, MySQL is fine too).

Use Docker Compose to spin up frontend + backend + db together.

Frontend → Vue in Nginx

Backend → Node.js/Express API (or Laravel if you prefer PHP)

Database → MySQL/Postgres

▶ Step 3 — Connect Frontend to Backend

Make a simple API route in backend, like /api/tasks.

Fetch it from Vue frontend with fetch or axios.

Confirm frontend ↔ backend ↔ db works in Docker Compose.

▶ Step 4 — Kubernetes (K8s)

Write manifests for frontend, backend, and db.

Deploy them in a local K8s cluster (Docker Desktop’s K8s or Minikube).

Add Ingress so the frontend can talk to the backend inside the cluster.

▶ Step 5 — Polish & GitHub

Add README instructions for all parts.

Add a screenshot of your UI.

Push repo → makes it nice for portfolio.
